Aletheia is a **cloud-native** solution for running a Directory Service. It consists of a Directory Server, which provides the building block, along with supporting components, such as Aletheia API and Aletheia Worker, that make Aletheia a complete ecosystem. For more information, see [Overview of Aletheia](/docs/concepts/overview/).
